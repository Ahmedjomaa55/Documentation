# Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a DevOps practice that aims to automate the deployment process of an application to production environments in a reliable, reproducible, and effortless manner. Here are the key steps involved in Continuous Delivery:

## Automated Deployment

Automate the deployment process of the application to production environments using scripts or orchestration tools.

## Infrastructure Configuration

Automate the configuration of the infrastructure required to run the application, such as servers, databases, networks, etc. Use infrastructure as code tools like Terraform, Ansible, or container management platforms like Kubernetes.

## Regression Testing

Run automated tests to verify that existing features have not been impacted by new changes. This can include unit tests, automated functional tests, integration tests, etc.

## Performance Testing

Perform load and performance testing to assess the application's performance under different load conditions. This helps identify bottlenecks and optimize the application's performance.

## Compliance Checking

Ensure that the application complies with security, privacy, and regulatory policies. Perform security scans, audits, and penetration testing to ensure the application meets security standards.

## Human Approval

Define mechanisms for manual approval and validation before deploying new features or patches to production environments. This may involve code reviews, manual testing, or approval processes defined by the team.

## Deployment to Production Environments

Deploy the application to target production environments using automated deployment mechanisms such as deployment pipelines, container orchestration tools, or cloud deployment tools.

## Monitoring and Incident Management

Continuously monitor production environments to detect potential issues and incidents. Use monitoring tools to collect metrics, logs, and alerts to ensure optimal availability and performance of the application.

## Rollbacks and Reversibility

Provide mechanisms for rollback and reversibility to revert to a previous version of the application in case of issues or incidents. This helps minimize the impact of deployment errors and quickly restore a functional state.

The goal of Continuous Delivery is to enable frequent, fast, and reliable deployments of new features or patches while reducing risks and ensuring a stable user experience. Popular CD tools include Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Spinnaker, among others.
