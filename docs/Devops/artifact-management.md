## Artifact Managers

An artifact manager is a tool used to store, manage, and distribute the software artifacts generated during the development and build process of a project. Artifacts can include binaries, libraries, configuration files, packages, container images, and other items generated by the build process.

Here are some examples of popular artifact management tools:
